This package adds occurrences of =TODO= and other keywords as messages of [[https://www.flycheck.org/en/latest/][flycheck]]. The keywords are configured in [[https://github.com/tarsius/hl-todo][hl-todo]]

[[file:flycheck-hl-todo-screenshot.png]]


* How it works
=hl-todo-flycheck-setup= should be called after all the other checkers has been registered. The checker =hl-todo= is registered as [[https://www.flycheck.org/en/latest/user/syntax-checkers.html#configuring-checker-chains][next checker]] of every other checker found in =flycheck-checkers=. This way, =hl-todo= checker will be invoked after the installed checker for the current major mode, and the results will be merged in flycheck error list.
 
=hl-todo= checker can be disabled as any other checker, with =M-x= =flycheck-disable-checker=.

For convenience, the buffer local variable =flycheck-hl-todo-enabled= can be use to activate or deactivate this checker.

* Install

[[https://github.com/flycheck/flycheck][flycheck]] and [[https://github.com/tarsius/hl-todo][hl-todo]] should be installed, but this  package is not available on melpa yet. You can use [[https://github.com/radian-software/straight.el][straight]]:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

(use-package hl-todo
  :ensure t)

(use-package flycheck
  :ensure t
  (global-flycheck-mode 1))


(use-package hl-todo-flycheck
  :ensure t
  :defer 5 ; Need to be initialized after the rest of checkers
  :straight (:host github :repo "alvarogonzalezsotillo/flycheck-hl-todo")
  :config
  (flycheck-hl-todo-setup))
#+end_src

=hl-todo= and =flycheck-hl-todo= can be activated independently. If you prefer to enable =flycheck-hl-todo= only when =hl-todo-mode= is enabled, you can use the following code:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun flycheck-hl-todo-follow-mode ()
  (setq flycheck-hl-todo-enabled hl-todo-mode)
  ;; Force flycheck update
  (flycheck-buffer))

(add-hook 'hl-todo-mode-hook #'flycheck-hl-todo-follow-mode)
#+end_src


* Customization
- =flycheck-hl-todo-extra-modes=: The checker will be enabled on every mode where other checker is already registered. Use this variable to define a list of modes where this checker will be also avaliable, although there is no previous checker for them.
- =flycheck-hl-todo-not-chained-checkers=: List of checkers that will not have this checker as next checker.
- =hl-todo-keyword-faces=: This variable belongs to =hl-todo= package. It contains the keywords to be added as flycheck messages.
