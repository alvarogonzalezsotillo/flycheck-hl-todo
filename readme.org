)

hl-todo-keyword-faces

* How it works
The checker =hl-todo= is registered as /next checker/ of every other checker found in =flycheck-checkers=. This way, =hl-todo= checker will be invoked after the predefined checker for the current major mode, and the results will be merged in flycheck error list.

=hl-todo-flycheck-setup= should be called after all the other checkers has been registered.

=hl-todo= checker can be disabled as any other checker, with =M-x= =flycheck-disable-checker=.

For convenience, the buffer local variable =flycheck-hl-todo-enabled= can be use to activate or deactivate this checker.
