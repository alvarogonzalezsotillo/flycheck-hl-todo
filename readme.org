This package adds occurrences of =TODO= and other keywords as messages of [[https://www.flycheck.org/en/latest/][=flycheck=]]. The keywords are the same used by for [[https://github.com/tarsius/hl-todo][=hl-todo=]]


* Install
This package is not available on melpa yet. You can use straigh:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package hl-todo-flycheck
  :ensure t
  :defer 5  ; Need to be initialized after the rest of checkers
  :straight (:host github :repo "alvarogonzalezsotillo/hl-todo-flycheck")
  :config
  (hl-todo-flycheck-setup)
)
#+end_src


* How it works
The checker =hl-todo= is registered as /next checker/ of every other checker found in =flycheck-checkers=. This way, =hl-todo= checker will be invoked after the predefined checker for the current major mode, and the results will be merged in flycheck error list.

=hl-todo-flycheck-setup= should be called after all the other checkers has been registered.

=hl-todo= checker can be disabled as any other checker, with =M-x= =flycheck-disable-checker=.
