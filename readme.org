This package adds occurrences of =TODO= and other keywords as messages of [[https://www.flycheck.org/en/latest/][flycheck]]. The keywords are configured in [[https://github.com/tarsius/hl-todo][hl-todo]]

* Install
This package is not available on melpa yet. You can use straigh:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package hl-todo-flycheck
  :ensure t
  :defer 5  ; Need to be initialized after the rest of checkers
  :straight (:host github :repo "alvarogonzalezsotillo/flycheck-hl-todo")
  :config
  (hl-todo-flycheck-setup)
)
#+end_src

* Customization
- =flycheck-hl-todo-extra-modes=: List of modes where this checker will be also avaliable. The checker will be available 
- =flycheck-hl-todo-not-chained-checkers=: List of checkers that will not have this fchecker as next checker.
- =hl-todo-keyword-faces=: This variable belongs to =hl-todo= package. It contains the keywords to be added as flycheck messages.

* How it works
=hl-todo-flycheck-setup= should be called after all the other checkers has been registered. The checker =hl-todo= is registered as [[https://www.flycheck.org/en/latest/user/syntax-checkers.html#configuring-checker-chains][next checker]] of every other checker found in =flycheck-checkers=. This way, =hl-todo= checker will be invoked after the installed checker for the current major mode, and the results will be merged in flycheck error list.
 
=hl-todo= checker can be disabled as any other checker, with =M-x= =flycheck-disable-checker=.

For convenience, the buffer local variable =flycheck-hl-todo-enabled= can be use to activate or deactivate this checker.
